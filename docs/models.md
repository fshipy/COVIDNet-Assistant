# Pretrained Models

The naming convention for models uses the following format:
```
COVID-Net Assistant - <base architecture>-<architecture version> (<dataset split (V - Verified Only or A - All Data)>)
```
For example, a COVID-Net Assistant model using the Large (L) Res-CNN-S based architecture which was trained on the dataset's verified-only split would be called "COVID-Net Assistant Res-CNN-S (V)".

## COVID-Net Cough Models on Verified-Only Split [TODO: upload pre-trained checkpoints]
These models are trained and tested on the Verified-Only Split of Covid19-Cough dataset
