**Note: The COVID-Net models provided here are intended to be used as reference models that can be built upon and enhanced as new data becomes available. They are currently at a research stage and not yet intended as production-ready models (not meant for direct clinical diagnosis), and we are working continuously to improve them as new data becomes available.

## Abstract

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to put significant burden on healthcare systems around the world, there has been growing interest into finding inexpensive symptom pre-screening and recommendation methods to assist in efficient use of available medical resources such as PCR tests. In this study, we introduce the design of COVID-Net Assistant, an efficient virtual assistant designed to provide symptom prediction and recommendations for COVID-19 by analyzing users' cough recordings through deep convolutional neural networks. We explore a variety of highly customized, lightweight convolutional neural network architectures generated via machine-driven design exploration (which we refer to as COVID-Net Assistant neural networks) on the Covid19-Cough benchmark dataset comprised of 381 cough recordings from a COVID-19 positive cohort verified by PCR test. Our experimental results shows promising, with the COVID-Net Assistant neural networks demonstrating robust predictive performance, achieving AUC scores of over 0.93, with the best score over 0.95 while being fast and efficient in inference.  The COVID-Net Assistant models made available in an open source manner through the COVID-Net open initiative and, while not a production-ready solution, we hope their availability acts as a good resource for clinical scientists, machine learning researchers, as well as citizen scientists to develop innovative solutions.
