## Abstract

As the COVID-19 pandemic has addressed the interests of the public in recent years, researchers are interested in finding effective and inexpensive screening methods to leverage the use of medical resources. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry coughs. Coughs have been used as a informal screening tool for a variety of diseases and we believe it can serve as a screening tool for COVID-19 detection as well. In this study, we introduce the design of COVID-Net Assistant, an efficient virtual assistant to provide status prediction and early recommendations for  COVID-19 by processing users' cough sounds through deep convolutional neural networks. We present multiple lightweight convolutional neural network architectures built with standard convolutions, residual blocks, and depth-wise separable convolutions. We trained and evaluated the COVID-Net Assistant neural networks on the Covid19-Cough dataset, which includes 381 pieces of cough audio with positive labels verified by PCR test. Our experimental results show COVID-Net Assistant neural networks have robust performance on the dataset split, excluding unverified positive samples. On average, our models can achieve over AUC score of 0.93, with the best score over 0.95 while being fast and efficient in inference. Â© 2022 .
